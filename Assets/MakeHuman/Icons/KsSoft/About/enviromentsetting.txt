----------------------------------------------
Environment Setting.
----------------------------------------------
■For MS-Windows:Install the cygwin.
A window data need to compile the script. This compiler invokes a gcc’s preprocessor.
Install the cygwin procedure in the MS-Windows environment as follows.

(a)Download the cygwin.
  https://cygwin.com/
  
(b)Installation by choosing the “Devel” package
  In the “Select Packages”, the Devel Default → Install.
  
(c)Add the PATH of system enviroment variable.
   Set the path to “bin” of the installed folder.
   It has become in the following folder by the default.
      C:\cygwin\bin (if 64bit version, c:\cygwin64\bin)
   [Note!]
   This enviroment variable is not cygwin!, it is the windows system enviroment variable.
   Please refer to the "For MS-Windows:Install the cygwin" of WindowSystem.pdf for detailed instructions.

(d)Confirmation
   Open a windows command prompt(not the cygwin's bash!), try typing “gcc --version”. If you have been installed,it is displayed as follows.
     windows comand prompt >gcc --version
     gcc (GCC) 4.9.3

   When you can not get the same result, you try to check two things.
     1)You confirm to exist gcc.exe in the C:\cygwin\bin directory.
       if you can not find gcc.exe, please rechecked the (b).
     2)If you find gcc.exe at the C:\cygwin\bin directory, please rechecked the (c).
     

■For OSX:Install the Command Line Tools in Xcode.
If you can not find the gcc on the terminal, please install the Command Line Tools in Xcode.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decide whether you use only a resources or use assetbundles and the resources
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■Only resources
Please set it as follows if you load data only using a resource without using the assetbundles.

  Assets/KsSoft/Plugins/KsSoftConfig.cs, line = 27
 	public static bool UseAssetBundle {
		get {
			return false;	//if you use resources without using assetbunle,you need to return false.
		}
	}

When it is configured to use the resources, the window system exports the resource data rather than assetbundles.

■Assetbundles and Resources
If your application has to download data via HTTP using asset bundle, please set it as follows.

  Assets/KsSoft/Plugins/KsSoftConfig.cs, line = 27
 	public static bool UseAssetBundle {
		get {
			return true;	//if you use resources without using assetbunle,you need to return false.
		}
	}

 

----------------------------------------------
This window system’s samples
   A preparation for run the samples
----------------------------------------------
■Run the sample scenes
 a)The sample which you can confirm each control behaviour.
   Run "KsSoft/Scene/Test/Test.unity"
 b)The sample which assumed that you used this in your application.
   Run “KsSoft/Scene/Initialize.unity”.
